## build

about dependecies read [here](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux

you also need vlang

to build client (server not yet ready) you need run that (for linux):

```sh 
cd client

make build # (production) make sure if you installed depends for raylib, and v

make devbuild # (development) same as ^^

make devrun # (development) simply v . && ./client, read about depends ^^^
```
